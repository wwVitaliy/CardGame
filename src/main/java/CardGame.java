/**
 * Card Game
 * Develop a Java program to simulate a card game.
 * A player is dealt three random cards (from a pack of 52) with values ranging from 1-13.\
 * The program should generate three random cards.
 * Aces are low in value (1) and Kings are high in value (13).
 * Jokers arenâ€™t played.
 * <p>
 * The player beats the house (wins the game),
 * if the sum of the three cards dealt is less than or equal to 21.
 * Otherwise, the house wins.
 * A duplicate card (for example, Ace of Clubs, should not be generated).
